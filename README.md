# UrbanMed-Sync
Hospital management system optimizing patient flow, bed availability, and inventory management.


"UrbanMed Sync"

Project Overview
UrbanMed Sync is an innovative hospital-based solution designed to streamline patient management in Outpatient Departments (OPDs), optimize bed availability, and enhance the admission process. Built on advanced queuing models, this system ensures efficient patient flow, reducing wait times and improving overall healthcare delivery.

The solution also incorporates robust inventory management modules to track the dispensation of medicines and consumables, ensuring that hospitals maintain optimal stock levels. This feature helps prevent shortages and overstocking, thereby supporting the efficient operation of medical facilities.

Key Features
Advanced Queuing Models: Implement queuing algorithms to manage patient flow in OPDs, reducing wait times and ensuring timely care.
Bed Availability Tracking: Real-time monitoring of bed occupancy and availability across hospital departments.
Patient Admission Management: Streamlined admission processes to ensure quick and accurate patient onboarding.
Inventory Management: Track the usage and availability of medicines and consumables, with alerts for low stock levels.
City-Wide Integration: Capable of integrating with city-wide healthcare modules to create a unified health management system.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy navigation and minimal training requirements.
Purpose
This project aims to modernize and digitize hospital operations, making healthcare more efficient and accessible. While the initial focus is on individual hospitals, the solution is designed to scale, with the potential to be integrated into a city-wide healthcare management system.
