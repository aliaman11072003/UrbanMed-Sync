Queuing Models in OPDs, Bed Availability, and Patient Admissions: A Hospital-Based Solution
Problem Statement ID: 1620
Problem Statement Title:
Queuing models in OPDs/availability of beds/admission of patients. A hospital-based solution is ideal which can be integrated with a city-wide module.

Description
The project aims to develop a comprehensive technological solution that addresses key challenges faced by hospitals in managing patient flow, bed availability, patient admissions, and inventory of medicines and consumables.

The solution will be based on queuing models in Outpatient Departments (OPDs) and provide real-time insights into bed availability and patient admissions. The project will also explore efficient inventory management systems to ensure the availability of necessary medicines and consumables at all times.

Though some modules have been developed by the NIC, their implementation in Delhi is pending. Our solution will build on this, aiming to integrate with the existing city-wide hospital management system.

Key Focus Areas:
Queuing Models in OPDs: Optimizing patient wait times and improving service delivery.
Bed Availability Management: Real-time tracking of bed occupancy and availability.
Patient Admission System: Streamlined and automated patient admission processes.
Inventory Management: Efficient tracking of medicines and consumables to avoid stockouts.
City-Wide Integration: Ensuring seamless integration with city-level health management systems for enhanced coordination.
Organization
Client: Government of NCT of Delhi
